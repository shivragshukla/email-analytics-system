# Email Campaign Analytics and Reporting System

This application is a simple **analytics and reporting system** for managing email campaigns. It includes user authentication, email campaign management, email sending and tracking, and a reporting dashboard to visualize campaign performance.

## Features

### 1. User Authentication
- **Registration** and **Login** functionalities are provided using Laravelâ€™s built-in authentication features.
- Only authenticated users can access the dashboard, manage campaigns, and send emails.

### 2. Email Campaign Management
- **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing email campaigns and email templates.
- Templates allow users to save reusable HTML messages for email campaigns.
- Campaigns include a subject line, selected template, recipient list, and metadata.
- Users can select from saved templates while creating or updating a campaign.

### 3. Email Sending and Tracking
- **Email Sending**: Users can send emails to a specified list of recipients for each campaign.
- **Email Status Tracking**: Track the status of each email (sent, delivered, opened).
  - **Sent**: Default email status set as sent.
  - **Delivered**: Updated through a webhook notification from the email provider.
  - **Opened**: Updated through a webhook notification from the email provider.

### 4. Reporting Dashboard
- Displays metrics for email campaigns, including:
  - Total emails sent
  - Emails delivered
  - Emails opened
- **Charts** visualize these metrics using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).
- Users can filter and select campaigns for a detailed view.

- **Backend**: Laravel 11 (API with Repository Design Pattern)
- **Frontend**: Vue 3, Pinia (state management), Tailwind CSS
